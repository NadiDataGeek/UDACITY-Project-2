    "The dataset wrangled in the project is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. \n",

    "My wrangling efforts for the WeRateDogs Twitter project included gathering data from the following sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tThe WeRateDogs Twitter archive. The twitter_archive_enhanced.csv file was provided to Udacity students. WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.\n",
    "•\tThe tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file was provided to Udacity students.\n",
    "•\tTwitter API and Python's Tweepy library to gather each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count at minimum, and any additional data I find interesting.\n",

    "Assessing Data\n",

    "\n",
    "\tmissing data in the following columns: in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp, expanded_urls\n",
    "\ttweet_id is an int (applies to all tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tValidity:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tdog names: some dogs have 'None' as a name, or 'a', or 'an.'\n",
    "\tthis dataset includes retweets, which means there is duplicated data (as a result, these columns will be empty: retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id and retweeted_status_timestamp)\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAccuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "\ttimestamp is an object\n",
    "\tretweeted_status_timestamp is also an object (the other retweeted statuses are floats)\n",
    "\trating_numerator goes up to 1776\n",
    "•\tConsistency:\n",
    "\trating_denominator should be a standard 10, but there are a multitude of other values\n",
    "\tthe source column still has the HTML tags\n",
    "images:\n",
    "•\tValidity:\n",
    "\tp1, p2 and p3 columns have invalid data...why would the algorithm labeled a dog photo as a starfish, boathouse, or mailbox (among other things)?\n",
    "•\tConsistency:\n",
    "\tp1, p2 and p3 columns aren't consistent when it comes to capitalization: sometimes the dog breed listed is all lowercase, sometimes it is written in Sentence Case.\n",
    "\tin p1, p2 and p3 columns there is an underscore for multi-word dog family:\n",
